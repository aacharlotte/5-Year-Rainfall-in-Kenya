# Rainfall Time-Series Analysis and Visualization

## Project Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive time-series analysis of monthly rainfall data in **Kenya** across the years **2018 to 2022**. Using **Python**, the analysis investigates rainfall distribution patterns and regional disparities to aid in understanding seasonal trends and climate variability.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations  
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and customization

## Problem Statement
Kenya's agricultural productivity and water resource planning are heavily dependent on predictable rainfall patterns. However, significant interannual and regional variations pose challenges to planning. Analyzing historical rainfall data helps inform mitigation strategies and climate adaptation planning.

---

## Aim of the Project
- To visualize and analyze monthly rainfall trends in Kenya from 2018 to 2022.
- To compare regional variations (Nairobi, Kisumu, Mombasa).
- To interpret seasonal patterns and identify anomalies.
- To build visually appealing and informative plots for data storytelling.

---

## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated
- Time-series data analysis  
- Line plots for temporal patterns  
- Heatmaps for monthly-seasonal distribution  
- Boxplots for distribution and variability analysis   
- Visual storytelling with matplotlib and seaborn

## Visualizations and Interpretation

### Kenya Rainfall Lineplot (2018–2022)

**Interpretation:**
- Nairobi, Kisumu, and Mombasa show distinct rainfall patterns across years.
- Peak rainfall varies by region and year, with some months showing sharp increases or decreases.
- Seasonal rainfall cycles are observable, with rainy months generally occurring around April-May and October-November.

### Heatmap: Avg. Monthly Rainfall by Region (2018–2022)

**Interpretation:**
- **Kisumu** has the highest rainfall in **July (313mm)** and **May (289mm)**.
- **Mombasa** shows relatively consistent rainfall, with peaks in **February (263mm)** and **April (245mm)**.
- **Nairobi** shows high rainfall in **February (286mm)** and **March (235mm)**, followed by a significant drop in **July (106mm)** and **December (86mm)**.
- The dry spells are visually evident with lighter shades and lower values.

---

### Boxplot: Yearly Rainfall Distribution by Region

**Interpretation:**
- **Kisumu** consistently has a higher median rainfall across all years, indicating a wetter region overall.
- **Nairobi** shows wider interquartile ranges and outliers, suggesting fluctuating monthly rainfall.
- **Mombasa** has relatively stable distributions but a broader spread in 2022, pointing to variability in that year.
- Variations within each year reveal how rainfall shifts not only regionally but also month to month.
